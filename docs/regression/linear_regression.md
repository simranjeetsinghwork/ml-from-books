# Linear Regression

Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable \( y \)
and one or more independent variables \( X \) using the equation:

$$
y = X\beta + \epsilon
$$

## Concept Summary
- Objective: minimize squared error
- Assumptions: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality
- Solution: \(\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\)
