# Introduction to MLOps

## MLOps
Set of operational processes to manage ML models, their code and the data they rely on to ensure reliable and trustworthy application of ML in real world problems.

## Landscape of MLOps
1. Data Management
    - Purpose: Handling data required for ML
    - Concepts: Data versioning, Feature stores, ETL, Pipelines
    - Tools: DVC, Pachyderm, Feast, Ray, Spark

2. Model Versioning and Delivery
    - Purpose: Storing and managing different versions of trained models
    - Concepts: Model versioning, validation and testing, automated delivery
    - Tools: Git, MLflow

3. Model Deployments and Experimentation
    - Purpose: Build better, reproducible ML models
    - Concepts: ML frameworks, Pipelines, Experiment tracking, Hyperparameter tuning, Scalable training
    - Tools: MLflow, ML Pipelines, Ray, Horovod
