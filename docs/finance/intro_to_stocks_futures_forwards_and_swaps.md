# Introduction to Stocks, Futures & Forwards and Swaps

## Stocks
A stock is security that gives its owner the right to a proportion of any profit that might be distributed (rather than reinvested) by the firm that issues the stock.

### Definitions
- Stockholder / Shareholder: The owner of the stock.
- Dividends: The profits that the company distributes to the stockholders. Generally random, depends on firm's profits and policy.  

Stocks are risky assets, as compared to Bonds which are risk-free.

### Stock's Performance
- Profits - Positive Returns
- Losses - Negative Returns

Sources of returns:

- **Dividend Gains**: Dividends received while in ownership of the stock.
- **Capital Gains**: On selling. `Selling Price - Buying Price`.

### Getting Long or Short
**Short Selling**: Borrow the stock from someone (owner) at current price and then sell it. Short seller hopes that the price goes down in future. In the future, rebuy the stock at lower price and give it back to the owner. This position is called the *Short Position*. Returning the stock to the owner is called *Covering the Short Position*.

**Long Position**: Act of buying the stock.

NOTE: In case of Bonds: Short Position is taken by the Debtor, who issues bonds. Long Position is taken by the Creditor who buys bonds.
