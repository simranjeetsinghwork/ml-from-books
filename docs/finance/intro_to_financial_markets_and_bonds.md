# Introduction to Financial Markets and Bonds

## Financial Markets
A financial market is a market in which people trade financial securities and derivatives at low transaction costs. Some of the securities include stocks and bonds, raw materials and precious metals, which are known in the financial markets as commodities.

## Bonds
### Definitons
- Bond: Fixed income securities which give the owner the right to a fixed, predetermined payment at a future predetermined date
- **Nominal Value** / Face Value / Par Value / Principal: The amount of money that the bond will pay in the future.
- **Maturity**: The date on which the payment is received.
- Debtor: The party that promises to pay in the future.
- Creditor: The party that will get paid.
- **Interest**: The difference between the bond price and the nominal value.
- Interest Rate: The interest as a percentage of the bond value.

For example: In a fixed deposit, the customer is the creditor, and the bank is the debtor. Here, the bank is the **counterparty** to the customer, and vice-versa.

In principle, bonds are **risk-free securities**.

### Types of Bonds
- Depending on Maturity:
    - Short-term bonds: One year or less in maturity
    - Long-term bonds: More than one year in maturity
- Based on Payment Schedule:
    - **Pure Discount Bonds**: Bonds that involve only an initial payment (initial price) and a final payment (nominal value).
    - **Coupon Bonds**: The debtor makes periodic payments, to the creditor during the life of the bond, called the *coupons*.
- Price at which the bond is sold:
    - Above Par: Higher than the nominal value
    - At Par: Exactly at the nominal value
    - Below Par: Lower than the nominal value

Pure Discount Bonds are, for obvious reasons, sold below par. However, coupon bonds can be sold at either par.

### Risks associated with bonds
- Credit Risk / **Default Risk**: Debtor fails to meet the payment obligations. More common with corporate bonds than the govt bonds. If the debtor fails to fulfil the promise, we say the debtor has *defaulted*.
- Inflation Risk: Inflation rate might be more than the interest rate.
- Liquidity Risk: Risk of having to sell the bond prior to maturity at a lower price (due to some personal need).
